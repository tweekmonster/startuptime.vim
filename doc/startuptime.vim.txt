INTRODUCTION                                    *startuptime.vim*

Everybody knows that 1ms could mean the difference between life and death in
Vim. This plugin breaks down the output of --startuptime so you can zero in on
the scripts that are stealing dozens of your milliseconds each time Vim is
started. You won't even need to leave the comfort of Vim.

STARTUPTIME USAGE                               *:StartupTime*

:StartupTime [file] [num_samples] [-- extra args]
			Profile the specified VimScript [file], running its
			contents [num_samples] times, using the supplied extra
			arguments verbatim in the program execution.

			If [file] is not specified, your vimrc (as specified
			by $MYVIMRC) is profiled.

			If [num_samples] is not specified, 10 samples are run.
